# Roles and Permissions Matrix

The Tinkerers' Lab platform utilizes a strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. All security enforcement happens both on the frontend UI (hiding/showing buttons and pages) and securely on the backend via Firebase Security Rules (`firestore.rules`).

> [!NOTE]
> All users default to the `student` role upon registration. Elevated roles can only be granted by an existing `super_admin` through the Admin Panel.
>
> Role checks are enforced **server-side** by `firestore.rules`: a user's `role` must be recorded in their `users/{uid}` document, and the account must be **active** (`isActive != false`). There is **no hard-coded owner override** in the application code — every permission is derived from the stored role.
>
> **Deactivation:** when an admin sets `isActive = false`, the Firestore rules treat the account as inactive. Deactivated users can no longer create bookings, tool checkouts, projects, issues, feedback, or workshop registrations, and they lose read access to other users' projects. (Catalog reads — equipment/inventory/maintenance/workshops/announcements — remain available to any authenticated user.)

## System Roles

1. **Super Admin (`super_admin`)**
   - The highest level of access.
   - The only role capable of accessing application settings and modifying other users' roles.

2. **Faculty (`faculty`)**
   - Elevated staff role intended for professors and instructors.
   - Designed to oversee operations (workshops, bookings) and view analytics, but prevented from altering core application settings or users.

3. **Lab Assistant (`lab_assistant`)**
   - Elevated staff role intended for student workers and technicians.
   - Responsible for day-to-day operations: managing inventory, updating equipment status, executing maintenance, and handling bookings.

4. **Student (`student`)**
   - The default standard role.
   - Limited strictly to viewing resources, requesting bookings, checking out equipment, and managing their own data.
