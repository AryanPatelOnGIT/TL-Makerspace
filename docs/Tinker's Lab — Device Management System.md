## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| June 26, 2026 | Use Google Forms + Sheets + Apps Script as core stack | Free, scalable, no coding expertise needed |
| June 26, 2026 | Split equipment into 3 tiers (Book / Checkout / Free) | Different tracking needs per equipment type |
| June 26, 2026 | Separate Project Registration from Machine Booking | Users register once, book machines many times |
| June 26, 2026 | 4 user types with conditional form sections | Students, Professors, Startups, External all have different info needs |
| June 26, 2026 | Machine-specific sheets routed by Apps Script | Easier to track usage history per machine |
| June 26, 2026 | MVP first, scale later | Get system running in 2-3 days, add features incrementally |
| August 10, 2026 | Global `cleanFirestoreData` payload sanitizer | Prevents `undefined` field errors from failing Firestore `addDoc`/`updateDoc` writes |
| August 10, 2026 | Custom Dark OLED Date Picker (`AestheticDatePicker`) | Replaced native browser date pickers with dark popover calendar, presets (Today/Tomorrow/Next Week), and Lime accents |
| August 10, 2026 | Structured Agreement Panel & Neon-Yellow Chips | Harmonized form agreements with `AgreementCard` square checkmark boxes and neon-yellow (`lime`) equipment chips with tick icons |
| August 10, 2026 | Resilient Feedback Submission | Added permission-safe local storage buffering for feedback/issue forms to guarantee smooth user experience |
| August 10, 2026 | Admin Project Status Fix | `AdminProjectsPage` resolves the Firestore doc ID via a fallback lookup by sequential project code (e.g. `TL-001`), surfaces permission-denied errors with actionable guidance, and uses `cleanFirestoreData` before `updateDoc` |
| August 10, 2026 | Super Admin Bootstrap Override | `AuthContext` hard-codes the owner email (`patelaryan19407@gmail.com`) as `super_admin` so the platform owner retains admin access even if the stored `role` is mis-set |
| August 11, 2026 | Firebase Config Fail-Fast | Removed unconditional development credential fallbacks; `lib/firebase.ts` now throws if no `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`/`_B64` is present unless emulator mode (`VITE_USE_EMULATORS=true`) is explicitly enabled |
| August 11, 2026 | Per-User Feedback Cooldown | Feedback rate-limit key is now scoped by UID (`tl_feedback_lastSentAt_{uid}`) so one account's submission never blocks another |
| August 11, 2026 | Dashboard Booking Filter | Upcoming schedule now drops completed same-day sessions (today's bookings require `endTime >= now`) while keeping date + start-time sorting; added the `userId`+`date` composite Firestore index |
| August 11, 2026 | Local-Time Date Utilities | `todayStr()` now constructs the date from local `getFullYear`/`getMonth`/`getDate` instead of UTC `toISOString()` to avoid off-by-one today-highlighting near timezone boundaries; `getWeekDays` and all `new Date(weekDays[...])` call sites parse YYYY-MM-DD as local midnight (`T00:00:00`) |
| August 11, 2026 | FieldValue Sentinel Preservation | `cleanFirestoreData` detects Firestore `FieldValue` sentinels (e.g. `serverTimestamp()`) via `_methodName` and returns them unchanged so `createProject` and `createBooking` writes are not stripped |
| August 11, 2026 | Component Accessibility Pass | Resolved 6 nested-interactive/accessibility issues: (1) `AestheticDatePicker` clear button moved outside trigger `<button>` as a sibling `<button>`, (2) Equipment card "Book" quick-action changed from `<span>` to `<button>` sibling, (3) `ProjectListPage` `EntityCard` receives `as="button"` for focusability, (4) `AgreementCard` tracks local checked state for uncontrolled checkbox registrations, (5) `BookingCalendarPage` My Bookings panel renders a loading state before empty-state, (6) `IssueFormPage` catch block shows error toast and keeps form mounted for retry |
| August 11, 2026 | Staff Tool Checkout Includes Returned | Added `getAllCheckouts()` to `toolCheckouts.ts` returning all checkout records (active + returned); staff view in `ToolCheckoutListPage` now uses this so the "Returned" filter shows actual data |
| August 11, 2026 | Project Edit Preserves Agreements | `ProjectFormPage` edit-flow `updateDoc` payload now includes `safetyAgreementAccepted` and `termsAccepted` so agreement changes are persisted alongside project fields |
| August 11, 2026 | FilterChip API Cleanup | Removed unused `tone` prop from `FilterChipProps` and all `tone="dark"` usages in `AdminProjectsPage` — the prop was silently ignored |
